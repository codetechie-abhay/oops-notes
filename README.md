## 🔍 Abstraction

**File:** [abstraction.md](abstraction.md)

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. This file provides a detailed explanation of abstraction with examples.

## 🏗️ Constructor

**File:** [constructor.md](constructor.md)

A constructor is a special type of member function that initializes objects of a class. This file covers the different types of constructors and their usage in OOP.

## 📋 Copy Constructor

**File:** [copy_constructor.md](copy_constructor.md)

The copy constructor is used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. Learn about its importance and how to implement it effectively.

## 🔒 Encapsulation

**File:** [encapsulation.md](encapsulation.md)

Encapsulation is the technique of bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, such as a class in OOP. This file explains how encapsulation helps in protecting the data from outside interference and misuse.

## 🤝 Friend Function

**File:** [friendfunction.md](friendfunction.md)

A friend function allows access to private and protected members of a class. This file elaborates on how and when to use friend functions in OOP.

## 🧬 Inheritance

**File:** [inheritance.md](inheritance.md)

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behavior of an existing class. This file discusses different types of inheritance and their implementation.

## 🔀 Polymorphism

**File:** [polymorphism.md](polymorphism.md)

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. Explore the concept of polymorphism and its significance in OOP through this file.

## 🧩 Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

**File:** [VirtualFunctionAbstractclasses.md](VirtualFunctionAbstractclasses.md)

This file covers the concepts of virtual functions and abstract classes, which are crucial for achieving runtime polymorphism and designing extensible and flexible code.
